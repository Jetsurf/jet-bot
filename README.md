# Splatnet/Music Bot
Splatnet/Music bot was originally created to be a music/soundclip playing bot. It 
has evolved into its primary purpose of fetching data about Splatoon 2 
maps/Splatnet to help discord servers to access this information 
quickly.

## Installation

If you don't care about self-hosting the bot, you can use the following link:

[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/542488723128844312.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/542488723128844312)

For self-hosting:

Requires a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal

Requires https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py discord python library to 
function (Version >= 1.3 needed) as well as all dependencies for it.

Requires youtube-dl and ffmpeg for online video/music playback.

Soundclips are to be placed in a directory defined by discordbot.json.

Requires a mysql backend, configured in discordbot.json.

## Configuration
An example configuration file is given at discordbot.json.example.
This file needs to be completed and moved to discordbot.json.

Soundsdir is a directory to place soundclips to play with the !file
command.

You can also configure some settings at runtime with [admin commands](#admin-commands).

## Commands

The default command prefix is `!`. You can also send commands without the prefix by @mentioning the bot:
```@Splatnet/Music Bot nextmaps```

You can always run `!help` to get a list of the commands regardless of the prefix. Also, you can run
`!prefix`. 

The following sections list the different commands that are available.
